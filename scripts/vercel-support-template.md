# Vercel Support Request Template

## Issue Summary
Persistent deployment failure with "An unexpected error happened when running this build" despite successful builds.

## Build Details
- **Project**: v0-pink-cart-landing-page
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.16
- **Build Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (all 28 pages generated)
- **Error Phase**: During "Deploying outputs..." 
- **Error Message**: "An unexpected error happened when running this build"

## Build Log Evidence
```
21:52:53.885  ✓ Generating static pages (28/28)
21:52:54.074 Build Completed in /vercel/output [43s]
21:52:54.285 Deploying outputs...
21:53:30.477 An unexpected error happened when running this build.
```

## What We've Tried
1. ✅ Removed all console.log statements
2. ✅ Simplified Next.js configuration to minimal
3. ✅ Fixed "latest" dependency versions to specific versions
4. ✅ Removed complex headers and experimental configurations
5. ✅ Verified build completes successfully every time

## Current Configuration
- Minimal Next.js config with only essential settings
- Fixed dependency versions (no "latest" versions)
- No complex experimental features
- Clean, simple configuration

## Request
This appears to be a Vercel infrastructure issue rather than a code problem since:
- Build completes successfully every time
- All 28 pages generate without errors
- Error consistently occurs during deployment phase
- Code has been simplified to minimal configuration

Please investigate the deployment phase issue.
