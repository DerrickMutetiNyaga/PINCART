console.log('=================================')
console.log('')
console.log('‚úÖ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:')
console.log('')
console.log('1. üö´ Client API Filtering Problem:')
console.log('   - Client API was filtering: { inStock: true }')
console.log('   - Admin API was fetching: ALL products')
console.log('   - Products with inStock: false were hidden from clients')
console.log('   - New products might not have inStock field set properly')
console.log('')
console.log('2. üîÑ API Difference Found:')
console.log('   - /api/products: Product.find({ inStock: true })')
console.log('   - /api/admin/products: Product.find()')
console.log('   - Admin shows all products, client shows filtered')
console.log('   - This caused the discrepancy you noticed')
console.log('')
console.log('3. üéØ Root Cause:')
console.log('   - Some products in database have inStock: false')
console.log('   - Or inStock field is not set (undefined/null)')
console.log('   - Client API was excluding these products')
console.log('   - Admin API was showing all products regardless')
console.log('')
console.log('‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED:')
console.log('')
console.log('1. üîÑ Removed inStock Filter:')
console.log('   - Changed client API to: Product.find()')
console.log('   - Now matches admin API behavior')
console.log('   - All products will be returned to client')
console.log('   - No more filtering by inStock status')
console.log('')
console.log('2. üé® Added Debugging:')
console.log('   - Added console.log in API to show product count')
console.log('   - Added console.log in client to show received count')
console.log('   - Easy to track if products are being fetched')
console.log('   - Helps identify any remaining issues')
console.log('')
console.log('3. üõ°Ô∏è  Consistent Behavior:')
console.log('   - Client and admin now use same query')
console.log('   - All products visible to both admin and client')
console.log('   - No more hidden products due to filtering')
console.log('   - Consistent product display across the app')
console.log('')
console.log('üéØ TECHNICAL CHANGES:')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Removed { inStock: true } filter from client API')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Changed to Product.find() like admin API')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Added debugging logs for product counts')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Ensured consistent behavior between admin and client')
console.log('')
console.log('üöÄ EXPECTED RESULTS:')
console.log('   ‚úÖ All products from database will show on client')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Client will match admin product display')
console.log('   ‚úÖ No more missing products on client side')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Consistent product visibility across the app')
console.log('')
console.log('üí° DEBUGGING:')
console.log('   - Check browser console for product count logs')
console.log('   - Check server logs for API product count')
console.log('   - Verify all products now appear on client')
console.log('   - Compare admin vs client product counts')
console.log('')
console.log('üéâ CLIENT SHOULD NOW SHOW ALL PRODUCTS!')
